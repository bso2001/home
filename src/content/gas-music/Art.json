	"bannerText" : "<span class=\"Album-Desc\"><p> These tracks started out as improvised pieces, recorded in one session at Hilltop Road on New Year's Day, 1988.  On that evening, Ray played guitar and bass, I played guitar, and Frank Romond and Lee Walsh manned various keyboards and drum boxes.</p><p>It seems that the tracks then sat around for a while.  Eventually, I began to rework them, finishing up in March of 1989.  There were orginally more than 3 pieces; some were combined to create the 23 minute Goodbye Blue Monday (a title I copped from Vonnegut).  Many guitar and keyboard parts were added, and many original parts were replaced.  This resulted in some controversy.</p><p>The original recordings were done on 4-track analog tape, and the easiest way to redo parts was to punch in, and record over them.  In retrospect, it clearly would have been better to have saved the original session.  Still, I've always been happy with the results. </p></span>",
