Frank Romond and Lee Walsh would ultimately become complicit as well.</p><p>Early on, Ray termed these sessions <i><b>Gas Music from Jupiter</b></i> (a phrase borrowed from the Firesign Theatre album <i>Everything You Know is Wrong</i>).  Gas Music gatherings were a thing for us throughout the 80's,  resulting in some 20 sessions.  An attempt will be made to document as many as possible.</p>",
