	"bannerText" : "<p>Beginning in the late 70's, a series of rather insane improvisations took place.  Initially, these were perpetrated by Ray Nering and myself. Frank Romond and Lee Walsh would ultimately become complicit as well.  Many others wandered in at one time or another, lending both spiritual and musical support.</p><p>Early on, Ray termed these sessions <i>Gas Music from Jupiter</i> (from the Firesign Theatre album <b>Everything You Know is Wrong</b>).  Gas Music gatherings were a fairly regular thing throughout the 80's.</p><p>There have been some 20 GMFJ meetings. An attempt will be made to document as many as possible.</p>",
