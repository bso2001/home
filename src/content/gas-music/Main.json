Frank Romond and Lee Walsh would ultimately become complicit as well.</p><p>Early on, Ray termed these sessions <i>Gas Music from Jupiter</i> (from the Firesign Theatre album <b>Everything You Know is Wrong</b>).  Gas Music gatherings were a thing throughout the 80's.  The result was some 20 sessions.  An attempt will be made to document as many as possible.</p>",
