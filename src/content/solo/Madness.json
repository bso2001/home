Recorded using Steinberg's <i>Cubase</i> on a giant Dell tower running <i>Windows</i>.</p><p>Once the music was done, I put down guide vocals intending to use a real singer.  Dave Moscara came in one night and did some vocals.  It's a mystery as to why Dave never did the rest of the vocals.  Thus, the version presented here has Dave's very nice vocals on the first three tracks, and my dodgy attempts on the rest.</p><p>Post Script.  RIP Dave; this music is now forever in your honor.</p>",
