	"bannerText" : "<p>An appropriate name: there was a fair amount of madness here.  This is one over-worked album.  It took 220-some-odd days spent in my Grandin studio during 2002 and 2003.  This was also my first digital recording, using Steinberg's <i>Cubase</i> DAW on a Dell PC.</p><p>Once the music was done, I put down guide vocals with the idea that someone would redo them.  Dave Moscara came in one night and did some vocals for three tracks.  It is an unfortunate mystery as to why Dave did not do vocals for the other tracks.  Thus, the version presented here has Dave's very nice vocals on three tracks, and my very rough vocals on the rest.  The \"bonus\" tracks are versions of the three Dave songs without Dave.</p>",
