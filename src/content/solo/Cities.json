We did not discuss style or structure. It simply had to incorporate 42 minutes of manic drum parts.</p><p>Incidentally, the drum parts were hand-written as around 50 pages of drum sheets. Frank then tapped these parts into a Roland TR-505 drum box. Crazy.</p><p> This music was produced on the venerable Tascam 22-4; three tracks of live instruments plus an FSK sync track. On the live tracks were all the guitars, some real bass guitar, a few live keys, and some noises. The FSK track provided MIDI sync, driving the TR-505 and a Yamaha QX-5, a hardware sequencer containing MIDI data for most of the keyboard parts.</p>",
