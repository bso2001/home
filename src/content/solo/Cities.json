There was no discussion style or structure.  It just had to fit over the 42 minutes of manic drum box parts.</p><p>Those drum parts, by the way, were all written out.  Frank showed up with like a hundred pages of hand-written drum sheets.  He then tapped these parts into a Roland TR-505 drum box.  Crazy.</p><p> This music was produced on the venerable Tascam 22-4; three tracks of live instruments plus an FSK sync track.  On the live tracks were all guitars, some real bass guitar, a few live keys, and some noises.  The FSK track provided MIDI sync, driving the TR-505 and a Yamaha QX-5, a hardware sequencer containing MIDI data for most of the keyboard parts.</p>",
