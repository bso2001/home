I simply had to incorporate 42min of quasi-manic drumming.</p><p>Parenthetically, the drum parts were hand-written on about 50 sheets of paper. Frank used these charts and “tapped” the parts into a Roland TR-505 drum box. Crazy.</p><p>The music was produced on the venerable Tascam 22-4; three tracks of guitars, some bass, some noises, and an FSK sync track. FSK provided MIDI sync, driving the 505, as well as a Yamaha QX-5 hardware sequencer, containing MIDI data for the keyboard “overdubs.”  Crazy.</p>",
