Not many years later, we met drummer Frank Romond, and by the mid-to-late 70's, we decided we were a band called <i>Providence</i>. <p> Mark Dobry soon joined as the bass player.  Ansel Spada became the singer.  Dana Vagovsky and Dean Rubine played keyboards on some projects.  </p> <p> For ten years or so, we recorded lots of originals, all of them on analog tape.  And all these guys were a big part of my life through all those years.</p>",

The bass, drums, and some rhythm guitars were recorded on September 8-9, 1984 at Earthquake Studios in Scotch Plains.</p><p>Most of the guitars, the keyboards, and vocals, were added at Cedar Lane during October.  The final mix was apparently produced in a marathon session on November 9.<p/>"
