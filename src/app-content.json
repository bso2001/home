On possibly the coldest morning ever, some people who wished to play music instead met for breakfast in a Burger King.  Not a bad plan by our host: see what shows up before letting them in your house.  Some of us met once to play some rather uninspired covers, and I thought that was that.</p><p>After a couple months, Rick reached out, and ultimately we produced these tracks between March and December of 2010, and never once recorded together.  I wrote music, organized into what felt like coherent songs, recorded draft versions, and sent them off to Rick.  He wrote lyrics, recorded lots of vocal parts, and added some guitars and live percussion.  He then sent them back for incorporation into the master copy in Tracktion.  I added guitars, keys, bass, and programmed the final Groove Agent drum tracks.  At last, final mixes were made, completed nearly a year to the day removed from that cold morning.</p></span>",

This is a curated collection thereof.</p><p>I picked the best parts, took out the really ugly bits, and sweetened the resulting tracks.  No sounds were added, and except for exorcising whole sections, nothing was removed.  The music was mostly spontaneous, with two exceptions: <i>High Chaparral</i> was worked out a bit, and there have been quite a few <i>Scandinavian Jazz Jams</i>.</p></span>",
