Not many years later, we met drummer Frank Romond, and by the mid-to-late 70's, we decided we were a band called <i>Providence</i>.  </p> <p> Mark Dobry soon joined as the bass player.  Ansel Spada became the singer.  Dana Vagovsky and Dean Rubine played keyboards on some projects.  </p> <p> For ten years or so, we recorded lots of originals, all of them on analog tape.  And all these guys were a big part of my life through all those years.  </p>",
