The current version of [bertolsson.com](https://bertolsson.com), built using React in August 2020.

The source is stored in, of all places, the **src/** directory.  In there you will find:

**elements/** containing common components such as display cards (based on Material UI), etc.

**pages/** are the individual pages, which use these components.

**content/** contains JSON files that define the content displayed on the site; though static, this data could be delivered by API without any significant change to the UI.

NOTE: as of March â€™23, the music section is removed in favor of a Bandcamp link.
