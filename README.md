The current version of bertolsson.com, built using React in August 2020.

Source is in, of all things, the **src/** directory.  In there you will find:

**elements/** containing common components such as display cards (based on Material UI), the audio player, albums/tracks, etc.

**pages/** are the individual pages, which use these components.

**content/** contains JSON files that define the content displayed on the site; though static, this data could be delivered by API without any significant change to the UI.
